## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.  
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 


## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week (HINT: use the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
options(digits = 1, scipen = 999)
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(weight_pounds = weight *0.00220462) %>%
  group_by(vegetable, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarize(total_weight = sum(weight_pounds)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day_of_week, values_from = total_weight)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the plot from the `garden_planting` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(weight_pounds = weight *0.00220462) %>%
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>%
  summarize(total_harvest = sum(weight_pounds)) %>%
  left_join(garden_planting, by = c("vegetable", "variety"))
```

The problem is that some vegetable varieties have two rows. For example, carrots of the Dragon variety have two rows with a total harvest of 4.11 lbs. One of these rows has plot H, and one has plot L. Additionally, with the left join, some varieties have `NA` values for the plot. We could remove these NA values by doing an inner join so that only vegetable varieties with a plot are listed, but then you lose some of the vegetables that were harvested. We could also filter that only one plot is shown and each vegetable variety has only one row (such as the plot with the first date), but this could be very misleading. 

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `garden_spending` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.
  
`garden_spending` has data on each vegetable and variety's price and price with tax.\

Step One: summarize `garden_harvest` so that it is compatible with garden spending, which has one row and the amount spent for each vegetable and variety. Group by `vegetable` and `variety` and change the weight to pounds with `mutate()`. Then sum the weight in pounds for each vegetable. \

Step 2: Do a left join of the `garden_harvest` dataset by variety and vegetable with `garden_spending` in order to add the price information to `garden_harvest`. Information on `brand` and `eggplant_item_number` is also added but is not necessary for this problem. We would then go to the Whole Foods website and could create a dataset with columns of `vegetable`, `variety`, and `price_per_lb_whole_foods` that lists the price of each vegetable variety for a pound of the vegetable. We would then add a line to the code below that left joins this dataset, again by vegetable and variety. The `price_per_lb_whole_foods` column would be added to the output below. Use distinct to remove any rows that got repeated in the joining process. \

Step 3: Using mutate to create `price_whole_foods` which is equal to `price_per_lb_whole_foods` * `total_harvest`. Then use mutate to create a variable called `amount_saved` which is equal to `price_whole_foods` - `price`. Use summarize to sum `amount_saved` to find the total amount saved. 
```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>%
  mutate(weight_lbs = weight *0.00220462) %>%
  summarize(total_harvest = sum(weight_lbs)) %>%
  left_join(garden_spending, by = c("vegetable", "variety")) %>%
  distinct()
  #left_join(whole_foods_veggies, by = c("vegetable", "variety)) %>%
```

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
#smallest to largest first harvest date
garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>%
  group_by(variety) %>%
  summarize(first_harvest = min(date), weight_lbs = sum(weight*0.00220462)) %>%
  mutate(variety = fct_reorder(variety, first_harvest)) %>%
  arrange(first_harvest)

garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>%
  group_by(variety) %>%
  summarize(first_harvest = min(date), weight_lbs = sum(weight*0.00220462)) %>%
  mutate(variety = fct_reorder(variety, first_harvest)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight_lbs, y=variety)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(y = "", title = "Total harvest (lbs) for tomato varieties, ordered by first harvest date (most recent at top)", x="") + 
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot", plot.title = element_text(size = 10))
```

Grape tomatoes had the first harvest date and volunteer tomatoes had the last. Over 60 pounds of Amish Paste tomatoes were harvested, which was the most out of any variety. Volunteers had over 50 pounds harvested. Jet Star tomatoes yielded the least amount of pounds. 

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(variety_lowercase = str_to_lower(variety), 
         variety_length = str_length(variety)) %>%
  group_by(vegetable, variety_lowercase) %>%
  summarize(variety_lowercase, vegetable, variety_length) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(vegetable, variety_length)
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(variety = str_to_lower(variety), has_ar_er = str_detect(variety, "er|ar")) %>%
  filter(has_ar_er == TRUE) %>%
  summarize(vegetable, variety) %>%
  distinct()
```

## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sdate))+
  geom_density() + 
  labs(title = "Bikes rented in Washington D.C. from Capital Bikeshare during final quarter of 2014", x = "") + 
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```
  
We see that there are the most riders during October of 2014, and the amount of riders slowly tapers off throughout November and December as the weather gets colder. 
  
  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), minute_decimal = minute(sdate)/60, time_of_day = hour+minute_decimal) %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_of_day))+
  geom_density() + 
  labs(title = "Time of rentals of Capital Bikeshare bikes during final quarter of 2014", x="time of day")
```
 
We can see that most bikes were ranked between 7:00 and 20:00 in Washington D.C. Specifically, the most rentals occurred around 8:00 am and 5:30 pm as people came and left work.  
  
  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=day_of_week)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "maroon") + 
  labs(title = "Capital Bikeshare Rentals in Washington D.C. during final quarter of 2014", x="", y="")
```
  
The days with the highest amount of rentals at Capital Bikeshare were Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays. The days with fewest rentals are Saturdays and Sundays. However, the entire distribution is pretty uniform, especially during weekdays.  Overall, the pattern suggests that bikes may be renting the bikes to get to work. 

10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE), 
         hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute_decimal = minute(sdate)/60, 
         time_of_day = hour+minute_decimal) %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_of_day))+
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week))+ 
  labs(title = "Rental times for Capital Bikeshare Rentals during final quarter of 2014", x="time of day", y="")
```

Yes, there is a pattern. We see that bikes are commonly rented around 8:00 am and 5:30 pm each weekday, indicating they are used for commuting to and from work. On the weekends, most bikes are rented throughout the daytime. The most rentals occur in the afternoon, between 12 and 5 pm. 


*The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises.*

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE), 
         hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute_decimal = minute(sdate)/60, 
         time_of_day = hour+minute_decimal) %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_of_day, fill = client))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week)) + 
  labs(title = "Rental times for Capital Bikeshare during final quarter of 2014", x="time of day", y="")
```

We see that during the week registered bikers commonly rent during the commuting times while casual bikes rent throughout the day. On weekends, registered and casual bikers rent on a similar schedule. The renting time distribution for casual bikers is pretty constant no matter if it is a weekend or weekday. 

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE), 
         hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute_decimal = minute(sdate)/60, 
         time_of_day = hour+minute_decimal) %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_of_day, fill = client))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA, position = position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week))+ 
  labs(title = "Rental times for Capital Bikeshare during final quarter of 2014", x="time of day", y="")
```
 
In my opinion this is much worse for telling a story. It is much harder to tell the size comparison of how many casual versus registered riders there are each day as well as when the riders rent each day. For example, during weekdays, unless you look closely, it seems like casual riders are renting a lot at the commuting times like the registered riders when really this is not the case at all. 
  
  13. In this graph, go back to using the regular density plot (without `position = position_stack()`). Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE), 
         hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute_decimal = minute(sdate)/60, 
         time_of_day = hour+minute_decimal, 
         weekend = ifelse(day_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend", "weekday")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_of_day, fill = client))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(vars(weekend)) + 
  labs(title = "Rental times for Capital Bikeshare during final quarter of 2014", x="time of day", y="")
```
  
Again, this graph emphasizes how registered riders rent bikes at commuting times during the week and throughout the day during the weekends. On the other hand, casual riders rent throughout the day no matter if it is the weekend or a weekday. 
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE), 
         hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute_decimal = minute(sdate)/60, 
         time_of_day = hour+minute_decimal, 
         weekend = ifelse(day_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend", "weekday")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_of_day, fill = weekend))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(vars(client))+ 
  labs(title = "Rental times for Capital Bikeshare during final quarter of 2014", x="time of day", y="")
```
  
This graph allows us to more easily compare how casual and registered riders rental times changes whether it is a weekday or weekend. For example, we see just how similar casual riders rental times are on weekdays versus weekends, and how registered riders have a much different schedule depending on weekend/weekday. I don't think one graph is necesarrily better than the other, but I prefer the graph faceted by weekend/weekday. 
  
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  group_by(sstation) %>% 
  count() %>%
  inner_join(Stations, by = c("sstation" = "name")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=lat, y=long, color = n))+
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "latitude", y="longitude", title = "Departures by station location for Capital Bikeshare", color = "Departures")
```

The stations with the most departures appeared to be grouped together, around the latitude and longitude of (38.9, -77.04).

  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r, }
options(digits = 4)
Trips %>%
  group_by(sstation, client) %>%
  count() %>%
  inner_join(Stations, by = c("sstation" = "name")) %>%
  group_by(sstation) %>%
  summarize(long, lat, client, prop = round(n/sum(n), 2)) %>%
  filter(client == "Casual") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=lat, y=long, color = prop)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Proportion of trips from each Capital Bikeshare station by Casual bikers", x="latitude", y="longitude", color = "proportion")
```

We see that stations with trips made from over 50% casual riders are grouped in two areas, specially around (38.88, -77.04), and (39.1, -77.15). These stations may be close to major attractions such as the Lincoln Memorial at (38.89, -77.05). 

### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
(popular_departures <- Trips %>%
  mutate(sdate = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  group_by(sstation, sdate) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(n=10))
```
  
18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(sdate = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  inner_join(popular_departures, by = c("sstation", "sdate"))
```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(sdate = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  inner_join(popular_departures, by = c("sstation", "sdate")) %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(client, day_of_week) %>%
  count() %>%
  group_by(client) %>%
  summarize(day_of_week, prop = round(n/sum(n), 2)) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = day_of_week, names_from = client, values_from = prop)
```

From this table we see that from the top 10 date-station combinations with the highest amount of departures that from these stations (Lincoln Memorial and Columbus Circle/Union Station), casual bikers used the stations primarily on the weekends while registered bikers used them more often during the week.

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
  
Notes: \
- text = white \
- line segments with arrows \
